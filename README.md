# Wantsome - Project X

## NOTES:

 - This is just a __template__ for your final project (to be completed at the
   end of the course).  
   It's just a basic working gradle project, with a default folder structure
   and including some common libraries.

 - __IMPORTANT__: after you finish your project, __replace this whole section__
   with something more relevant for your specific project!
  
   It could contain something like: 
   - short description of the __purpose and scope__ of your project
   - __initial setup instructions__ (init db, others?)
   - __usage instructions__
   - interesting __technical details__ about how you built it (libs used, db, etc)
   
   To format it nicely using __MarkDown syntax__, see guide: 
   https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/
 
 - TODO: may also rename the base package `wantsome.project` to something more 
   appropriate to your project
